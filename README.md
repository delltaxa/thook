# THook

This webpage allows you to tunnel and dualhook an webhook

Example

Instead of sending stolen data directly to your discord webhook,
you send it to the tunnelhook site /join.php then this join.php
will send the message to both of the webhooks and blocks the ip
of the user who posted it. (If you add an anti-proxy, it will be almost impossible to spam)

Also if you go on the site it will display a fake webhook to trick the user into thinking
he found something
